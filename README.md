# Welcome to TaoDocs

**These documents were transcribed by TAOBard and although some of the main documentation has been implemented into this mdBook format, I haven't yet studied website creation thoroughly enough to integrate these into a website. If you would like to collaborate with me - I would love to work with other people in the Bittensor community. If you think you could further improve this documentation from the perspective of a teacher or student then please, get in contact as I would enjoy implementing better documentation if members of the community can write such things. I would love the assistance, as we are all learning. This is mainly an AI/Human analysis of the various files found within the Bittensor project itself, as well as how somebody would begin to interact with the Network from step 0(which would be owning a computer). By no means do I claim to be an expert at training ML Models, but I can get you started with some recommended base models. I can only offer these words for those curious about this obscure technology and if you haven't touched a Linux terminal before: get ready to learn a lot.**

## The Main Purpose of This Documentation:

1. The first point we must speak on the fact that, although designed as a blue-print for decentralized AI, the Network still exists in obscurity. 
    - For one thing, **this whole Network** is way older than people realize. Bittensor has been around the block in the AI world, and these people that are building the Network work around the clock to develop the documentation, the functions and the over-all security of this Network. 

#### So if it's so obscure, why should we adopt it?

1. Bittensor essentially forces you to learn about computer science, which is an increasingly in-demand field that people are paying good money for. From engineering prompts to building out a secure Network database, Bittensor utilizes a foundational skill-set that any computer scientist should be familiar with. 
2. Along with this, apps are being developed on the Network, and there is now an API. The Prompting Network is accessible through Python scripts! 

## Can I use these documents on my website?

If you want to, these docs are open-source, same as Bittensor - but I would create your own interpretation with more accurate knowledge. If you would like to collaborate, please reach out to me - and I hope you find this a useful resource on your journey.  

# Big Patch 5/16/23 - 

**I took some time to truly reflect on what information was wrong, what needed to be changed, and what else I could add into these documents to give more insight into what's been built, what will be built, and what ***can*** be built. I corrected lots:**

1. Finney and Prompting
    - I have clarified miner/validator requirements a bit and given some recommendations on equipment to rent on the cloud.
2. How Should I Approach Bittensor
    - Section updated to give insight into the changing dynamics of the network and how one can approach the opportunity of it. Currenty, mostly prompting. 
3. Muli-Modality
    - Just some insight into what that side of the network could look like, and the current status as of 5/16/23. 
4. Learn to Write Documentation
    - Well, I think everybody takes notes, but also, I think better documentation is needed for a great deal of projects everywhere. Good skill to have. 

## Additions 

The additions for now are relatively small, but I am working on other documentation and videos to help further understanding of the Bittensor network. If you would like to donate to the cause, 5Cysz8fsZdCycYicdqxUtbycV9ccBbFsyvkbpnZknRZvKCFR - Thank you, and I hope these docs help!
