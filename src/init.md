# What Should My Focus Be? 

## Learning.

This network is massive, increasingly complex, and something that not everybody can build on. Anybody who has ever mined knows it's a full time job, and requires a lot of trouble-shooting and updating. That being said, with the prompting network now a thing, fine-tuning models becomes more understandable as each day progresses. If you put in the time and effort with this network, you will be rewarded - and mining will get easier and more diverse as time progresses.

With multi-modality soon to be integrated over time, there will be many more options as far as mining goes, and there's a lot of opportunity to make TAO as a developer at the moment. If you know how to train LLMs, this is an amazing community to get involved with.
