# What is Multi-Modality?

To put it simply, it is the ability for any form of generative AI to plug into the network. This could mean prompting an LLM, an Image network, a Voice network, etc - the options are limitless. These will come to the Network overtime in the form of subnets, as Bittensor grows and develops, I'm sure we will hear more about them. I recommend following the Twitter scene or being in the discords to see the latest updates on what is going on within the community. 

It's looking exceedingly brilliant as time goes forward and the subnets are in development.
